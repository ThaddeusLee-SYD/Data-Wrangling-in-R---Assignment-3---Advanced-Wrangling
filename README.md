# Data-Wrangling-in-R---Assignment-3---Advanced-Wrangling

This is the third and final assignment for Data Wrangling and formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

Assignment 3 involves finding 2 publicly available data sets, tidying them and merging them so that it can then be used to answer a question that may be of interest.

For Assignment 3, I have chosen two data sets covering Indian Premier League (IPL) Cricket.

I find cricket interesting as the way it is played, and scored make it a very statistics heavy sport.

Both datasets were obtained from Kaggle, a website where individuals and organisations can provide datasets on a wide range of topics. The first dataset covers the player auction that takes place in February each year where teams bid on players to join their team(Cricket Mastery, 2022 ). 

The dataset was uploaded to KAGGLE by user VINITSHAH0110, with the data being scraped off pubicly available information sources as Wikipedia and various news websites covering the auction (VINITSHAH0110, 2022 ). The auction has become a major event in India. Our second data set, covers IPL player statistics and contains data on players such as their bowling and batting statistics (Vora, S 2022 ). Both datasets were available from Kaggle as CSV files. Data analysis plays a major part in sports like cricket, particularly when yearly player auctions are held where a lot of money is involved. With this information in mind, I thought it would be interesting to
merge both auction and player datasets together to create a dataset that might give insight into the sorts of statistics that might attract highest bids.
